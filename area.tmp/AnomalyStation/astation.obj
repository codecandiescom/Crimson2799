needler pistol~
a needler pistol~
Someone left a nasty-looking needler pistol here.~
The needler pistol looks very nasty... to anyone without armor. The pistol 
slivers off needle-sized shards from a block of amunition and propells them 
at an extremely high velocity. Each individual needle doesn't inflict much 
damage, but the high fire rate of the pistol ensures overall damage is 
significant.

A HUGE game rifle is sitting here.~
It's amazing what people can get through customs. This "game rifle" uses 
belts of .50 calibre rounds at a very high rate of fire. Under the tan and 
khaki paint you can just make out "Terran Assault Rifle" stamped in the 
side. There must be some awfully big game out there.
