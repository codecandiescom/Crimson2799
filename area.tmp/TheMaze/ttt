< The Maze Level 1: The maze was created by the builders to challenge and
< test their young. It as since become the home to serveral "tennants" who 
< don't particularly care for visitors.
< 
< Level 1 features a simple puzzle of "get the pegs & put them in their baskets".
< Successfull completion of the puzzle will gain exp and a +1 int necklace. 
< Note the puzzle doesn't have to be solved to get through the maze - a feat
< which also yields a one-time exp prize. Each exp bonus may only be granted
< once per player, regardless of death.
