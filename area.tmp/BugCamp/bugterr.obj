most of the anomaly is uncharted.  Well, you have found it. Let's see how it 
works. (Try PRACTICE'ing)

Someone left a nasty-looking needler pistol here.~
The needler pistol looks very nasty... to anyone without armor. The pistol 
slivers off needle-sized shards from a block of amunition and propells them 
at an extremely high velocity. Each individual needle doesn't inflict much 
damage, but the high fire rate of the pistol ensures overall damage is 
significant.
