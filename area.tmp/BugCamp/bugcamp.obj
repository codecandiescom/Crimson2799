a modified needler pistol is laying on the ground here~
This slightly modified version of the needler pistol has new, never before 
seen technology added by the Yurks that boosts the firing rate slightly. If 
you thought the original Needler Pistol packed a punch, wait untill you get 
nailed with one of these.

diary~
a blood covered book is here~
Day 4: We have arrived at the Yurks nest and are setting up camp just 
outside the entrance. So far we have seen no signs of life out of the nest 
but we can hear the faint sounds of something deep within the caves. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Day 7: We have sent a small team of troops into the Yurk's nest but have 
not heard anything from them and we fear the worst. The sounds from inside 
the nest seem to be getting closer to us and there have been rumors of 
sightings around the entrance to the nest. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Day 11: The Yurks have emerged from the nest and are extremly hostile! 
Retreate has been ordered but it is too late. I fear this may be my last 
entry, and if anyone lay hands on this I warn you, do NOT come anywhere near 
this camp site if you value your life..
