A dense ring glowing in deep shade of red is lying here.~
  The ring glows in deep shade of red.  The ring is very dense for its size,
but that is of no surprise knowing that it's composed of neutronium.  This
rare metal is forged by sub-atomatically fusing extra neutrons to depleted
uranium.  Neutronium has been rumoured to have special spiritual properties,
but GalCiv Health authority reports that it causes severe brain damage,
causing mental degeneration with frequent exposure.  Humans like to adorn
themselves with this item because its shiny and rare, another nail on the
coffin on the theory of their craziness.

particular model, GALR-1, is a single stream rifle preferred by the 
militia's special divisions.  It is illegal for non-military personnel to 
posess this rifle, so the demand for the assault rifle is high in the black 
market.  If you are an outlaw, you will most likely have the honor of having 
your brain vaporized by this laser from 300-400 feet away.   ^cHrm..  there 
seems to be something different about this rifle, someone has attached a 
magnetic accelerator to the pulse generator housing.  You wonder at the 
point of trying to make the rifle more powerful, it can slice through just 
about any metal.

Entry 1

   Just like that, my service in the GalCiv United Military was over.
I still cannot believe they court-martialled me for diciplining my
men.  I'm on board the Shuttle Genova, heading for the Anomaly Station.
It is my hope that I can get hired as a bodyguard, where I can kill and
get paid.
.........
Entry 9
   Well, that was just great.  The Artificer I got hooked up with, who
was looking to further his intellegence through builder-tech, just fell
off a cliff while I was taking a little nap in the clearing.  I'm going
to look for his body tomorrow, hoping that I can lift some useful items
from his dead body.
.........
Entry 15
   Well, life is grand.  I have found my perfect army.  Too stupid to
question orders, and with the willpower to do anything they are told.
It took me a bit of time to understand their language, thank god the
Artificer had a translator.  I plan to train my army and defend what is
my TERRARIUM!
