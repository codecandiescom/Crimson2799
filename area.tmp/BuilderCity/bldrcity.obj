object statues~
builder statue~
Two statues are erected here, each standing on one side of the road.~
  This is certainly a peculiar statue.  The thing depicted here doesn't even
look remotely humanoid or siliconoid.  Details of their anatomy is difficult
to make out for the figures are wearing robes and hoods.  One statue is 
wearing a ^ggreen ^brobe while the other is wearing a ^ppurple ^brobe. From
what you can make out, the things represented here either have their
heads attached to the chest or have very large shoulders.  Each statue
is holding a beautifully adorned staff.

object medallion~
a medallion~
a medallion is left forgotten here.~
  What a strange artifact.  You cannot determine what it is composed of
nor which race is responsible for making it.  It looks plain enough,
but you are drawn to it by some unexplainable force.  There is a symbol
of X on one side of the medallion.
