a SPAS-15 rifle lies on the ground~
A SPAS-15 assault automatic shotgun rifle. Although it is single barrelled, 
its fully-automatic feature makes up for any loss. This drum-fed beauty is a 
favorite of the human space marines.

The low level shield generator is a very efficient way of protecting oneself 
from harm. This pocket size microwave g-band emmitter gives a protective

plasma cutter~
a plasma cutter~
a plasma cutter is lying here, its smoking and very hot.~
Although it was intended for use as a cutting tool to aid in starship 
construction and repair, since it will cut through pretty much anything it 
makes a devasting weapon.

corpse marine~
the corpse of a human marine~
The corpse of a human marine is here, looks like he met his doom...~
You dont think much of his taste in clothing, tacky green tunic, bare arms, 
and a dorky helmet. Looks like he was ripped to pieces by demons.

a builder power cell~
A dull gray coloured case made out of plastic is here.~
There really isnt much to see, its a grey box made out of some kind of 
industrial-grade plastic. The only thing of any interest is that it has two 
metal contacts at one end. Its about the size and shape of a deck of playing 
cards

portable generator~
a portable generator~
a portable electical generator has been carelessly discarded here~
  Its a 50 pound electrical generator. Even the builders used electricity it 
seems. It has positive and negative terminals and could be used to power 
pretty much anything. Considering builder technology it probably puts out as 
much juice as a fusion plant back home.

A metal crate hangs just above you, its suspended from a crane on the ceiling~
Its a sturdy metal crate. Cables from a crane 200 feet above you on the 
ceiling hold it just above your head. The sides of the crate are deeply 
corrugated and you could probably climb up on it if you wanted.

most of the anomaly is uncharted.  Well, you have found it. Let's see how it
