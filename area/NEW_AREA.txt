How to make a new area
----------------------

Step 1: create a new directory for it. Eg: "MyArea".

Step 2: copy the files blank.* into the area (rename them)
        eg: 
           blank.mob -> MyArea/myarea.mob
           blank.obj -> MyArea/myarea.obj
           blank.rst -> MyArea/myarea.rst
           blank.wld -> MyArea/myarea.wld

Step 3: Enter the area into the "area.tbl" file. 
        eg: 
           MyArea/myarea     9000 9199 corbin~
        Note the fields are:
           <area directory>/<area file base> <start virtual #>
           <end virtual #> <editor> ~
        Don't forget the ~ at the end!!
           
Step 3: go and edit the files .obj, .rst and .wld files in your
        directory and change the first line (#0) and change it
        to the first virtual # in your range (eg: #9000). 

Step 4: reboot your server!

That's it. Now you can go into your server and edit the new area
using the area editing commands or MOLE!!!
