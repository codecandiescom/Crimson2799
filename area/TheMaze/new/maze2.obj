large spindly statue~
Large spindly statue~
A large, spindly statue looms ominously in the centre of the corridor.~
The statue is of a tall, four-limbed creature. The limbs each have 6 joints, 
and are thin to the point of fragility. The face is adorned by a long, 
slender beak and bulbous eyes. The beak-face appears to be giving you a warm 
smile.

Stout blocky statue~
A stout, blocky statue is here, blocking most of the corridor.~
The statue is of a stout tri-pedal creature. Four horns protrude from the 
creature's face, which is centred in the middle of what could be considered 
it's chest. You can just make out a warm smile on its twisted face.

A builder couch is here... hmmm looks comfortable.~
The builder couch looks like a long, slender bench covered in nice soft 
cushioning. Perhaps, by lying on the couch, you could PRACTICE here. (type 
"practice").

message pad scratch paper~
Message Pad~
an old pad of paper is lying on the ground~
The pad has a message printed neatly on it: "Day 15. We are newly arrived to 
the far side of the first 'Maze' at a great cost in time and blood. Our 
sensors indicate at least two more catacombs lie ahead. Unfortunately, not 
all of us are fit to carry on. I have decided to split the group; MacGuire 
and Danfort will return the way we have come, along with the sick or 
wounded. I will carry on ahead with Tufort, Gumbo, and seven others. God 
willing, the next catacombs won't be like the last. -- Dr. Mary J. 
Greenwood"
