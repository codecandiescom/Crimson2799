builder couch~
A dusty old builder couch is humming quietly here~
The builder couch looks like a long, slender bench covered in nice soft 
cushioning. Perhaps, by lying on the couch, you could PRACTICE here. (type 
"practice").

old message pad paper~
An old message pad~
An old paper message pad has been left here.~
The message pad reads: "Day 23. We have made it to the third Octagon, and I 
am starting to understand this 'Maze'. The catacombs are obviously of 
builder design, but their intent has till now eluded me. I now believe these 
rooms compromise a Builder IQ test; builders were fed through these tests to 
rank and strengthen certain mental abilities. How these rooms were used in 
the context of their society remain a mystery, however. By the gods, they 
couldn't have been as brutal as they have become. We have lost Tufort, Smith,
Lu, and Beaufort. Gumbo is malfunctioning, but repair circuitry seems to be
compensating. Our equipment is lost, our rations low, our weapons empty or
broken. We cannot conceivably make it back out the way we came in. Thus we
have decided to continue on into the next 'test'. Let the log show that I have
promoted Ensign T. M. Morzit to Captain First Class. 

May the gods have mercy...             -- Dr. Mary J. Greenwood
                                          Commander, ARF 23

An EM field pistol~
A Dorian EM field pistol lies discarded here~
Its an EM field pistol. Although the Dorian EM field axe was a highly 
successfull weapon. Its ammo use was so prodigious as to limit its 
usefullness. Dorion engineers used the same technology base to produce this 
much more efficient pistol when it came time to equip the Guardians.

There really isnt much to see, its a red box made out of some kind of 
industrial-grade plastic. The only thing of any interest is that it has two 
metal contacts at one end. Its about the size and shape of a deck of playing 
cards
