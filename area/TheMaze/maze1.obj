distrupting flesh, armor, and most other physical objects.

Broken PDA~
A broken PDA is lying neglected here~
The PDA appears to have been dropped, and does not respond to any controls. 
Fortunately, internal circuits are still powered; you can read the last 
message entered into the PDA: " Day 47: I am lucky to be alive, though I 
fear my luck shall run out soon. I can gladly say, however, that at least I 
will not die in that hell, that 'Maze'. If my life might bring any meaning 
to this forgotten, merciless world, it will be to serve as a warning: DO NOT 
ENTER HERE. Nothing lies beyond except misery and death.                     
G. M. MacGuire                                                               
                       I'm sorry, Louise... "
