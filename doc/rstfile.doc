Maybe a hint as to any quests contained within.~

NOTE: Half of the above is only present for historical reasons, Zone# is 
not currently used (can be anything), ditto for First Room number (although
this will be an auto-populated field at some point so that the server 
can auto-relocate areas if their virtual range is changed in the area.tbl
file)


Current Reset Commands supported:
M - mobile to room              M <if> <mobile> <max>   <room>  [<room max>]
O - object to room              O <if> <object> <max>   <room>  [<room max>]
G - give object to last mobile  G <if> <object> <max>   
P - put object inside object    P <if> <object> <max>   <object>
E - equip mobile with an object E <if> <object> <max>   [<position>]
D - set door state              D <if> <room>   <exit>  <door_flags>
R - remove object from room     R <if> <room>   <object>
* - denotes a comment the rest of the line is ignored

To explain the table a bit:
<if> should be either 0 or 1, if it is 1 the command will only execute
if the preceding command executed. Typically used like:
M 0 3000 5 3000 2
G 1 3000 5
<max> is used to assign a maximum number of whatevers in the entire mud,
<room max> will limit the number in the current room. So if you had 2 guards
in each of 3 rooms, you would have two M commands in each room, all with a 
max of 6 and a room max of 2.
<position>
is currently being ignored, equip will auto-determine the correct position.
<exit> is the numeric representation of the exit, currently
 it doesnt support keywords, if this is a problem, tell me.
 (see EDIR entries in exit.h)
<door_flags> are taken from exit.h and currently include
1  EF_ISDOOR
2  EF_PICKPROOF
4  EF_LOCKED
8  EF_CLOSED
16 EF_HIDDEN
Add up those you would like set.
