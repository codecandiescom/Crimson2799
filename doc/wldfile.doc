World File field description:
=============================

Main structure notes:
---------------------

#<virtual number> is:
  A number for the given room. No two rooms may have the same number.
  The <virtual number> must always increase when browsing down the 
  world file (but increments can be larger than one).

<name>~<NL>:
  This name is the "title" of the room. This title is also used in special
  procedures like:
    "exits"
    "brief mode"

<description>~<NL>:
  This is the general description of the room.

<zone nr> is:
  The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is used
  for resetting zones and monster zone movement. See the zone file.

<room_flags> are:
  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions as:

  DARK           1  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          2  A player 'dies' (no xp lost) when entering.
                    It is a good idea to:
                     *Have these rooms light, because then EXITS will show
                      the room title, for example "In Boiling Water".
                     *Make exits to all rooms from which one can enter the
                      death_room, then the "death cry" will be heard by
                      other members of the group considering following...
  NO_MOB         4  No monsters may walk around in here
  INDOORS        8  This is inside (a house,cave or dungeon for example)
  LAWFULL       16  ??? 
  NEUTRAL       32  ???
  CHAOTIC       64  ???
  NO_MAGIC     128  Not implemented.
  TUNNEL       256  ???
  PRIVATE      512  It is impossible to teleport to this room if it
                    already contains two characters.
                    Also the 'teleport' spell will never teleport a
                    player into this room.

??? means that the flag isn't used yet (and you Shouldn't use it either!)


<sector_type> is:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
  movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

  SECT_INSIDE          0  Uses as if walking indoors
  SECT_CITY            1  Uses as if walking in a city
  SECT_FIELD           2  Uses as if walking in a field
  SECT_FOREST          3  Uses as if walking in a forest
  SECT_HILLS           4  Uses as if walking in hills
  SECT_MOUNTAIN        5  Uses as if climbing in mountains
  SECT_WATER_SWIM      6  Uses as if swimming
  SECT_WATER_NOSWIM    7  Impossible to swim water - requires a boat


Direction fields:
-----------------

<Exit number> is one of:
  0 = North
  1 = East
  2 = South
  3 = West
  4 = Up
  5 = Down

<general description><NL>~<NL>:
  What a player will see if he types 'look <direction>'

<keyword list>~<NL>:
  used for commands like 'open', 'close', etc. should be 'door' for ordinary
  doors. Example: An exit from a given room leads through a cupboard. The
  keyword list for this exit might look like this:

  "cupboard door~"


<Door flag> [NL]:
  See the exit flags in exit.h

  The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command in the
  reset-command table (see rstfile.doc)

<Key Number> [NL]:
  The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door (in the direction
  given). If a player carries/holds this object, he can lock/unlock.
  <Key Number> == -1 means no keyhole. If <Door flag> is 0, the value of this
  field is ignored.

<to_room> <NL>:
  The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this number is
  -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might be useful for
  adding an exit-description in a direction which doesn't actually lead
  anywhere.

** Note about doors. You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                     is set between.

Extra descriptions:
-------------------

<blank separated keyword list>~<NL> is:
  A list of the keywords that will allow the extra description to be
  displayed. The keywords must must be seperated by blanks.


<description><NL>~<NL>:
  The description that is show when a player types 'look at <keyword>'
  and keyword matches one of the above.

#100
The Lego temple~
   You stand in a tiny, red temple; built entirely from Lego bricks. It is,
sadly, not a very interesting place, and perhaps you should leave through the
portal which leads south to a sunny garden.
