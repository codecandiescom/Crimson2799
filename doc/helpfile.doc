The help system for the Crimson2 Mud Server works as follows:

there is a help/help.tbl file, in the form:
<filename> <editor list>~

last line should (just like every other data file really) look like:
$

(generally speaking though if you leave out the $ it will see the EOF and just
 go on gracefully)


And there are also many XXXXXXX.hlp file, each of which should be listed in
the tbl file.

each .hlp file is of the form:
Name of the section e.g. Main Command Help~
#
key1 key2 key3... lastkey~
blah blah blah the 
help for this command
goes right about here
~
#
lots more entries, until the last which looks like:

#
nextkey etc~
description~
$
