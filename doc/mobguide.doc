Mob Design Guidelines
=====================

the idea is that hit points at a given level should be suggested here
also HitBonus values, experience etc

Mob HitBonus:
First Level mobs should have a HitBonus of 0 or so, and I think as a general
rule of thumb they should get about 4% per level, so a 21st level mob
should have a hitbonus of roughly 80%.... basically if a mob with no
hitbonus strikes at a player (or mob) without any armor it will have a
50/50 chance of hitting. By the way, hit rolls are open-ended ala MERPS,
Rolemaster etc ie if a 95 or higher is rolled then it adds on another roll,
if a 5 or lower is rolled, it subtracts another roll. This means that rolls
above 100 or below 0 are both possible if rare.

Mob Armor:
This is the negative percentage added to hit attempts against this mob. (ie
a Mob with an armor value of 50, would for all intents and purposes, totally
impossible for a 1st level character to hit.)

Mob Level & Experience:
remember that players get dick all for killing a monster lower in level
than them, so be kind with 1st level monster experience values as they wont
be worth squat to players once they hit 8th .....

every level the player is higher than the mob is worth 1/8 less experience of
the normal value. it works the other way too, a mob 4 levels higher than the
player is worth 1/8th more of its normal value for every level it is higher,
ie
Monster level  Xp multiplier
-8             0
-7             1/8
-6             1/4
-5             3/8
-4             1/2
-3             5/8
-2             3/4
-1             7/8
0              1
+1             1-1/8
+2             1-1/4
+3             1-3/8
+4             1-1/2
+5             1-5/8
+6             1-3/4
+7             1-7/8
+8             2

Default settings:
Heres some formulas which will give you an idea of what a good starting point
is for mobs of a given level. Of course it goes without saying that to truly
balance your mobs you're gonna need feedback from players in your area.

hitbonus = (level * 3)
armor = (level * 3)
hitpoints = (level * 15) to (level * 20)
experience = (level * 15)
avg. damage = (level)
money = (level * 10) or (level*level) whichever is lower
(NOTE: This one varies quite a bit depending on how/where you encounter the
 mob)
