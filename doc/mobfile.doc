<action flags>[NL]

  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  The bits mean:

  ACT_SPEC         1  This means that there is a special programmed C
                      procedure connected to the monster. When this bit
                      is set the monster "function pointer" must be
                      assigned in the "spec_assign.c" file.

  ACT_SENTINEL     2  When this bit is set the monster will NOT
                      move around in the world.

  ACT_SCAVENGER    4  When this bit is set, monsters will pick up stuff
                      lying on the ground. It will pick up the most
                      expensive items first.

  ACT_ISNPC        8  RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE

  ACT_NICE_THIEF  16  When this bit is set, a monster will not attack
                      a thief which has been caught in the act of 
                      stealing from this monster.

  ACT_AGGRESSIVE  32  When this bit is set, the monster will attack and
                      attempt to kill any player it can get it's claws on.
                      It will not attack players it can't see (for example
                      dark rooms or when player is invisible, unless the
                      monster can detect invisibility)

  ACT_STAY_ZONE   64  When this bit is set, the monster will never move
                      into another zone of the world (this is good for
                      keeping your monsters in your own adventure).

  ACT_WIMPY      128  When this bit is set, the monster will flee when it's
                      getting percentwise low on hitpoints.
                      If the monster is both aggressive and wimpy, then it
                      will only attack players that are NOT awake! (ie. also
                      suffering players).

   -350 ..-1000 Evil Alignment

<Detailed/Simple flag><NL>

  This flag must be entered as a uppercase "S". S indicates that "Simple"
  monster data follow. Anything but an S will be interpreted as if
  "Detailed" monster data is to follow. We will NOT describe detailed
  monsters as they are VERY detailed.


<Level>
   This is the level of the monster. See "defs.doc" for guidelines when
   setting the level.

<THAC0>
   The monsters THAC0.

   guidelines for THAC0.
   THAC0 is an abbrevation for "To Hit Armour Class Zero".

   armour.

<Hit Points (format is xdy+z)>
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....


<Damage (as HP)><NL>
   This is the damage a monster will cause when it is using NO weapons
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exacly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points.
