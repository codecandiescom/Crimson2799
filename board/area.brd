poison~
Maybe poison affects should be made more apparent - like a message
reoccurring from time to time about you getting weaker or a message
that the poison tastes horribly or burns you when you drink it.

poison vs. VR~
You can *die* in the VR if you drink poison from the keg.

Changed poison to whisky in the keg in SilverDale, pending
some fix to the whole poison stuff.

breaking doors~
Idea: allow players to break some doors. Just as thieves can
pick and technicians hack (I guess), soldiers could break doors
with some of their weapons (axe, chain saw).
We'd prolly need another door flag then - NO_BREAK, for some
sensitive doors ;)

vacuumwalk~
It looks like the vacuumwalk affect doesn't go away immediately
after the space suit is removed.
