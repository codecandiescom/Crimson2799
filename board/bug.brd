Re:VR machines~
Nope, all you need is to remember to say 'hi' to
the mobs, in this case to Duah :)

Re:^Y<No Title>~
'get all corpse' works fine - what's the syntax you used?
As for here being a ghost mud - help fill it by inviting your
friends..

Advancement bug~
Before level:  
HP:[  109/  149]
MP:[  192/  221]
PP:[   70/   70]
During level it displays:
You gain 3 hit points (Your maximum is now 159)
You gain 12 move points (Your maximum is now 236)
You gain 1 power points (Your maximum is now 75)

The math isn't right if I gained 1 power point I should have 71 max now 
but I do have 75 like it said.  The number in () is correct on all 3 of 
these but the number it says I gain is not.
probably a simple typo in the code somewhere...

Re:Advancement bug~
Cryogen looked into it - it's not the actual number of points you gain
that is wrong - it's the message, which doesn't consider the stat bonuses.
So it's fortunately not a big problem, which is prolly going to be fixed
very soon anyway. Thanks for the report!

Spacesuit~
When you put on a spacesuit, then take it off again, the effect of wearing it remains, which makes no sense.
Also there is the problem of invis lasting forever.

Re:Spacesuit~
Typing 'stop' is the usual way to stop various things, effects
included. As for the space suit thing, yeah, we know about it and
were trying to think of a neat solution to this quite general
problem. Again, it should hopefully be done soon.
Again, thanks for your concern!

spacesuit again~
Also if you don't already know which you probably do there is the more major problem of that if you log on in space the spacesuit doesn't work because it appears to just use vacuumwalk on you when you put it on.

SpiritWalk fixed by Corbin~
Corbin fixed the SpiritWalk skill so that it really allows
you to go through doors now, EXCEPT in cases when
the door resists spirits (there are such doors).
Please post here if you discover any problems with that
(or any other thing - bugs DO get fixed here, although sometimes
it may take a while - as some people claim, imps are humans too ;)

Following A Police Officer then killing him causes server reboot
if you do these commands in order the server will reboot (i found this by accident)
Follow Police
--- then wait till you follow him out of the room
kill pol
and when you kill him the server reboots


the times when i did this i had a group of 3 of which I was the leader

thanks

Quit during VR~
Well, I don't REALLY want to tell you this, but I'd better.
If I quit the game during a VR training, and then restart, 
I come back in the shuttle bay with all of the nifty stuff
I got in the VR sim. That leaves me with a silver dagger and
shadowblade, which I think are probably better than the standard
issue pocket knife. I also have the keg, grapple, etc.
Hope this helps y'all!

VR Trainer~
Just so you know, when I re-entered the VR trainer and
exited by dying, the objects that I hard retained were
taken from me as they should have been in the first
place.

Tigger~
Selling things~
When selling things, buying things, or asking a shopkeeper the value of things,
other people who are in the room only see part of what is going on.
For example,  "Tigger sells" is all someone would see if they were in
the room when I sold something.
Another problem that only shows up when two people are together on the MUD
is during combat; if I'm fighting with a mob and someone else walks in,
my name and that of the mob are in red (OK), with strange gibberish added in...

Just some things to look at when y'all get a chance! :)

Prompt~
I can't get my prompt to display the experience needed for next level.  The prompt display says that %N is for XP for next level, but %N is also for name, I think.
