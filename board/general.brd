Here's a couple explanations for some psi skills that don't have help-files yet.
They're relatively self-explanatory based on their names, but here goes anyways:
Phantompocket - creates a pocket in which to store items that negates their weight while held within
Phasewalk - has a help file, but it negates a lot of the penalties incurred from a heavy inventory fyi
Mark - Sets the location for your recall point
Recall - I won't even bother on this one ;)
That's it for now :)

Head Engineer & The Phase-Induced Inverter~
Ok, as lots of people have found out, you have to kill the head engineer
several times before she actually has the phase induced inverter. 
This is wrong. She is supposed to have it *every* time. After some digging
I think I may have found the problem. SO, should you come accross the
head engineer and she DOES NOT have the inverter with her, LET ME KNOW.
Thanks.

To Attract More Players~
There is a webpage that takes a poll monthly for best all around MUD as well as best MUD of varying genres. It is called the MudJournal and is at www.mudjournal.com.
Perhaps if we got together and voted for this MUD it would help attract some attention from people perusing the polls looking for a good MUD.
I, at least, can honestly state this is the best MUD I have played, and the most enjoyable. If you agree with me and would like to help increase the player base: check out the site and cast a vote.
Thanks,
Maric

Phantom is now on a new HUB~
Don't know if y'all care, but Phantom now has a new hub of its own.
No, this doesn't mean it's got more throughput. It just means it'll
be sharing it with some laptops. No biggie.

Did you log in Oct 25 between 7am & 5pm PST?~
If you logged in to here between about 7am and 5pm on Oct 25, you 
are probably having difficulty getting access to your old characters.
This is due to a small server problem we had. If you were affected, 
let us know and we'll see if we can restore your lost character.

Corbin~
NO MORE CRASHES~
Well, I think I figured out what the problem was with the server. It looks
like a couple of run-away daemons setup some kind of back-and-forth 
race condition loop which generated huge log files and filled my disk drive
up! Ooops. Well, I've sinced smacked the offending daemons up side the head
and things are back to normal. This should *not* happen ever again.

Stupid head engineer~
I know... it sometimes creates the head engineer without a phase induced 
inverter. I don't know why. So I've now made it an object which the
head engineer now wears. Hopefully that will work. Before it was 
(inappropriately) set as a container. Well, no matter. If it happens again,
let me know. :)

New MOLE~
New MOLE version 1.34 is up on the web page. The main change is the 32-bit 
MOLE now has an optional separate input line for users to type commands 
into. Finally, no more chopped-in-half commands! Download and enjoy!

Heya all, hope you all enjoyed yourself in my absence :) *muaha*? Just
came in to show my face once more, but yet again I fear some players
are missing :/ Hmmz, I might be even foolish enough to come back playing /
building here, not sure though -- I have a brand new computer and a
cablemodem connection and I seem te be enjoying playing Quake 2 far too
much *snort* Heh, well at least a Vewwy Happy 1999 --- 2799AD is still
a long way to go!

Me and/or Corbin and/or Randor, have to do a quick review of the area, then it
will be opened. Corbin, (nudge nudge) needs to link it into the world as well.

Re:Re: Moby's area...~
I'm going through a really bad period now, free-time-wise..
But I promise to have a walk around it whenever I get hold of
a free access terminal (cause I'm paying WAY too much for the
net access recently, WAY too much :(
So I don't really mean a review, more like typo hunting, on a 
possibly already linked area.

Re:Re: Moby's area...~
That's a good theoretical question :) All I can suggest for now is waiting
to be transed out of there by an immortal (which, sadly, may take a while -
we're all real busy in real life now :( ). The thing is that apparently you need
to pick the lock which you probably cannot do yet. It's a really high level area,
those ducts :)

Re:^Y<No Title>~
While the cost of brain dump gets high for higher levels, people
rarely have problems getting credits for it below level 10 - just
kill a few shoppers or citizens and you're set. Remember to use
'consider' though!

Stuck~
Say, theoretically of course, my other character was wandering around in the
air ducts. Then, say, also theoretically, he accidentally found himself
greatly outgunned and outnumbered in the equipment stores. After several
attempts, this theoretical character may have been able to retrieve the
contents of his own corpse, but he would of course find himself stuck in
the hallway west of the equipment store. The door would be locked on that 
side too, so he wouldn't be able to get into the rest of the world. What
would be the best thing for this stuck character to do?

Sorry... "transed" out by an immortal? Would that involve my being
online at the same time as an immortal and asking to be...uh..."transed out",
or do I just apply for transing somewhere? Maybe at the central trans booth...

Robot City~
I just want to make sure whoever needs to know does... the description of
the area one s-e from the wall terminal (here) says that there's a place
called Robot City to the north. I'm sure it's just one of those things y'all
haven't done yet... I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten that
you'd put that in the description. (Because if you've set the Robot City idea
aside, you'd want to change the street description)

the mud as as such its never really taken off. Also the world is still a bit

Important Notice~
As many of you have no doubt noticed, both corbin and I have become too busy
to be much involved with the mud. Now I know I speak for both of us when I 
say I would love to see the mud continue (preferably for all eternity) since
I've put a lot of work into it over the years.

However in order for it to really continue and succeed the mud will need a 
good staff of immortals to take over for Corbin and I. As such if
you know an experienced mud coder or admin looking for a mud to get involved
in you might want to pass along the name of Crimson2799.
